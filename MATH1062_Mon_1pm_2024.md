### Lab Clarifications

Please see the Google Doc [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RhbVNUqfxhfdOSwpqWNJe_3jScqPlKjFJ8-oaWXgjW8/edit?usp=sharing) where I will place clarifications when needed on lab content. For example, if I am a bit unsure of what a particular answer is, I may add it to this Google Doc after the lab.

### Muddy Cards

Muddy cards are a way for you to to share the topic or concept that you have found to be the most confusing from the last week (i.e. your muddiest point). I encourage you to fill out the optional survey [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScEcto_Q1xELdqNzJgmy0TK43GzOaGAhMzxfU3-y-5aTGKzTg/viewform?usp=sf_link) to provide me with your muddiest point. At the end of the week, Iâ€™ll review the most common points of confusion and provide further explanation through a Google Doc or my personal website/blog.

### Student as Partners

As part of my commitment to being the best teacher that I can be, I will be conducting an optional mid-semester survey for you to provide feedback on how you are finding the tutorials and any ways I can improve my teaching style to support you.

### Weekly Resources

Please check back here at the end of each week. I will upload some of the content that I worked on during the labs (for example, the Rmd files from the tutor coding demonstrations).
