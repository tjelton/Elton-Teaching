# Welcome

Hi, this is a website containing teaching resources for classes taught by me (Thomas Elton).

The rationale behind this site:

1) By placing code on here after tutorials/labs, it means that students can focus on listening. When it comes to coding, my fear is that students will run into a bug whilst I'm demoing something and turn their attention to solving that bug. This could put them further behind, as they turn their attention from what I'm discussing.

2) To provide extra resources (such as website links) to aid student learning.

All content is provided for education purposes. Whilst I do my best to ensure that all information is up-to-date and accurate, I make no guarantees.
