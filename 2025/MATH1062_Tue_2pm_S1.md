### Lab Clarifications

Please see the Google Doc [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DIRwpYW_Vb5_NOzz3a6VVBduekBLo4gaNGXOyaKoBO8/edit?usp=sharing) where I will place clarifications when needed on lab content. For example, if I am a bit unsure of what a particular answer is, I may add it to this Google Doc after the lab.
