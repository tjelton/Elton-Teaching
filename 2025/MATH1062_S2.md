# MATH1062 Semester 2

### Lab Clarifications

Please see the Google Doc [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C8yYw8VzvxBtkNG-3FYrfUlaskbHwkvtnwBEZCy_DBs/edit?usp=sharing) where I will place clarifications when needed on lab content. For example, if I am a bit unsure of what a particular answer is, I may add it to this Google Doc after the lab.

### Extra Resources

##### Week 4

- In your assignments, you need to make sure you submit the .html file that you get from rendering your documents. As a reminder on how to do this, check the resource [here](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html#rendering).
- [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P10U2mL6tLVUYMBxEPXJN0hLW9ePJqJ7/view) is a resource I made when teaching another unit on how to create ggplots. You might find the 'painter' analogy helpful when thinking about how creating plots in ggplot works.
- [Here](https://posit.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/data-visualization-1.pdf) is a sheet made by posit with many of the different functions that you would need when using ggplot.

##### Week 6

- Interactive app/site I made to explain concepts in this course [here](https://tjelton.github.io/Hypothesis-Tests-Visualised/). Note: it will take a bit of time to load (30 seconds), but once it is loaded, it should be fast. If you would rather install it as an R package (which is faster), see the steps in the repository [here](https://github.com/tjelton/Hypothesis-Tests-Visualised).
- Please see the lab clarifications document above for some clarifications + tips.
