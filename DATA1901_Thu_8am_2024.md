### Lab Clarifiactions

Please see the Google Doc [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_wieMKts3et8c1_RAy8tRasAoEq5jmJ9X9vlaR31YAE/edit?usp=sharing) where I will place clarifications when needed on lab content. For example, if I am a bit unsure of what a particular answer is, I may add it to this Google Doc after the lab.

### Weekly Resources

Please check back here at the end of each week. I will upload some of the content that I worked on during the labs (for example, the Rmd files from the tutor coding demonstrations).
