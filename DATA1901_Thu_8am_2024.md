### Lab Clarifications

Please see the Google Doc [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_wieMKts3et8c1_RAy8tRasAoEq5jmJ9X9vlaR31YAE/edit?usp=sharing) where I will place clarifications when needed on lab content. For example, if I am a bit unsure of what a particular answer is, I may add it to this Google Doc after the lab.

### Student as Partners

As part of my commitment to being the best teacher that I can be, please help me by filling out the survey here (no longer accepting responses).

A discussion of the results from the survey can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OKydTYPRq0ENMtroR6Tf9q3dwRIw93JJ/view?usp=drive_link).

### Weekly Resources

Please check back here at the end of each week. I will upload some of the content that I worked on during the labs (for example, the Rmd files from the tutor coding demonstrations).

### Closing Remarks

It was a pleasure to teach you all this semester! I just had a few things that I wanted to close with:

- Please don't be a stranger! If you see me on campus, come up and say hi :) Also, once the course has finished, please feel free to add me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-elton-a86aaa215/) (I'd love to see what my ex-students are up to).

- I still have a plan to release some guides on how to approach some of the probability questions (I know that this was a challenge for some students). Once these are done (I plan to finish them in week 13), I will place them in the "Further Learning" cell of week 12. Please check periodically for this.

- There is a lunch for women doing data science majors in DATA1001. You can sign up [here](https://edstem.org/au/courses/15212/discussion/1940578). If your a women doing a data science major, I'd also recommend some of the following clubs (these were some suggestions I received from a colleague):

  - [R-Ladies](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-sydney/). Some of my colleagues in DATA3888 are highly involved in this club - I'd recommend checking it out.
 
  - You can also sign up for the WAMSOC (Women in Maths Society) club.
 
  - If you have any questions about these, email me at T.Elton@maths.usyd.edu.au. I won't know the answer, but I know people who do, and I'll find out and get back to you :)
 
- In general, after the course is finished, I'm also happy to provide any advice about university, data science, research, exchange, etc. that you might be interested about.
 
- University can be very stressful, and I know that for lots of you that this will be your first time sitting university exams. Please try to keep exams in perspective - they are not the be all and end all. What matters more is that you've learned some interesting things, but even more so, who you are as a person. Please keep your exams in perspective (I know that it is hard to do).

All the best,

Tom
